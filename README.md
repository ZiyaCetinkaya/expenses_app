# Personal Expenses App

This is the first project which I developed in the flutter learning process.

## About App
I did this project by following the course which is published by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind) on Udemy. [Click here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps) to access this course. I made this application after watching the 4th part of the course. 

## New Features

Apart from the improvements which is made in the course, I made the following additions:
- I added the category field to expenses. I have the user select it by using dropdown on the add expense screen.
- I changed the design of the expense on the expense listing screen.
- I used the Drawer widget to filter by date and category.

As I complete the other sections in the course, I want to continue to share by making additions to the projects.
